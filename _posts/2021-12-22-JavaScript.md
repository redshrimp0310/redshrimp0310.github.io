### FUNCTION

Anonymous function is the function without name.
We don't mention the type of parameter


There are three way of function creation. 

* function statement : 
we use function literal.
name of function must be stated. 
we don't need to add ';' in the end.

we can store the created funciton into variable.
this variable is reference variable.
name of function is optional.
we add ';' in the end.

if we mention the name of function and assign to the variable, we can access the function by calling the name of funcion. Instead, we need to use variable's name.
