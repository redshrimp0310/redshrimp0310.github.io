## FUNCTION
Function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task and anonymous function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. When creating a function, we don't declare value types.

### Three different ways of creating a function.

**Function Statement**

Function literal is used.  
Function name MUST be declared.  
Semicolons after function declarations are not necessary.

**Fucntion Expression**

Function literal is used.   
Function name is optional.   
Semicolons after function declarations are required.   
The funciton is stored into a variable.   
This variable is reference variable.

When we declare the function name and assign to a variable, we can't access the function by calling the funcion name. Instead, we need to call a variable's name.

The below function is internally amended by JavaScript Engine.

**Function() Constructor**

Function statement and function expression is the process of the simplified procedure of creating function by using of Function() constructor.

Syntax :
new Function(arg1, ... , argN, functionBody)

### Function Hoisting

Hoisting can allow functions to be used before they are declared in the code.

It can lead to the unexpected errors and is not normally recommended.

### Function in JavaScript is called first class object due to the following reasons:

*Can be created by literal.*  
*Can be assigned to variable, element of array, and property of object.*    

![JS](/img/JavaScript/JS2/2021-12-22-JS2-11.jpg)

*Can be used as an argument of function.*  

![JS](/img/JavaScript/JS2/2021-12-22-JS2-12.jpg)

*Can be used as a return value of function.*

*Property can be created and assigned dynamically.*

### There are additional standard properties defined into a function object such as arguments, caller, lengh, etc.

### Callback Function

Callback function is a function passed as an argument into another function.

### Immediate Function

Immediate function is a function that enables you to execute a function as soon as defined.

### Inner Function

### Closure

This is a feature where an inner function has an access to the outer function's variables.
