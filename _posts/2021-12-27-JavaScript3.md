## FUNCTION

### Function that return a function
As described in the last post, Function is treated as a first class object. So, Function is able to return a function.

### Arguments Object

Unlike C language, an error does not occur in JavaScript when passing more or less than two arguments as below.

Arguments Object is an array-like object passed into the function to represent the list of arguments that are passed in when a function is invoked.

Arguments Object is beneficial when we create a function with an unknown number of arguments.

### Function Invocation Patterns & This Binding

'This' argument is also passed into the function as well as Arguments object when a Function is called.  
  
When a Method is invoked, 'This' used in the Method refers to an object that called that method.

a Global variable is actually a property of a Global Object.

When a Function is invoked, 'This' used in the Function refers to a Global Object.

Same 'this' binding rule applies to when a Inner Function is invoked.

Code can be amended as below to overcome that 'this' refers to a Global object.

'this' inside a constructor function works differently when it's called.

When a constructor function is invoked without 'new' or a normal function is called with 'new', an error occurs. That's because 'this' inside a constructor function refers to a created empty object while 'this' inside a normal function refer to a 'Window' Global object.

Naming convention that the first letter of function name is capitalized is strongly recommended for a constructor function.
